	abstract = {Cette etude s'inscrit dans la continuite de travaux menes au laboratoire de mecanique des fluides et d'acoustique sur la modelisation spectrale de la turbulence isotrope compressible (marion (1988), bataille (1994)). Le modele precedemment developpe (modele e. D. Q. N. M. ) predit des dependances avec le mach turbulent (m\#t) des quantites compressibles (telles que l'energie compressible et la dissipation dilatationnelle) en m\#2\#t. Or une etude du systeme des equations servant a deriver le modele montre une dependance en m\#4\#t de ces quantites (en accord avec la theorie pseudo-son de ristorcelli (1995)). Ceci nous a amene a remettre en cause la forme retenue par l'e. D. Q. N. M. Pour la decorrelation temporelle des champs (en exp(-t)) et a retenir une forme en exp(-t\#2). Cette modelisation conduit a des dependances avec le mach turbulent coherentes avec le systeme initial. De plus, des comparaisons avec des simulations numeriques directes permettent de valider le modele. Un developpement analytique du modele, pour une faible compressibilite, est propose. Celui-ci permet de donner la forme et le niveau du spectre compressible en fonction des quantites caracteristiques de la turbulence incompressible. Il conduit a une relation liant la dissipation dilatationnelle a la dissipation solenoidale, relation susceptible d'etre utilisee au niveau des modeles en un point. Cette etude permet egalement de donner une forme analytique de la production acoustique. Cette forme est en accord avec les theories existant en acoustique. En particulier, la puissance totale rayonnee est trouvee proportionnelle a \#s m\#5\#t. Enfin, des extensions du modele sont etudiees : un modele prenant en compte la convection de la masse volumique et un modele exprime en termes de spectres d'energie sont proposes.},

The velocity field is decomposed into a solenoidal component and a compressible component in terms of the Helmholtz decomposition, and the compressible velocity component is further decomposed into a pseudosound component, namely, the hydrodynamic component associated with the incompressible field and an acoustic component associated with sound waves. It is found that the acoustic mode dominates over the pseudosound mode at turbulent Mach numbers Mt≥0.4 in our numerical simulations. At turbulent Mach numbers Mt≤0.4, there exists a critical wave number kc beyond which the pseudosound mode dominates while the acoustic mode dominates at small wave numbers k{\textless}kc. In the pseudosound-mode-dominated region, the compressible velocity is fully enslaved to the solenoidal velocity, and its spectrum scales as M4tk−3 in the inertial range. It is also found that in the inertial range, the spectra of pressure, density, and temperature exhibit a k−7/3 scaling for Mt≤0.3 and a k−5/3 scaling for Mt≥0.5.},

	issn = {0022-1120, 1469-7645},
	abstract = {We report results from direct numerical simulation ({DNS}) of stationary compressible isotropic turbulence at very-high resolutions and a range of parameters using a massively parallel code at Taylor Reynolds numbers ({RλRλR}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}it{\textbackslash}lambda\}\}) ranging from Rλ=38Rλ=38R\_\{\{{\textbackslash}it{\textbackslash}lambda\}\}=38 to 430430430 and turbulent Mach numbers ({MtMtM}\_\{t\}) ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 on up to 20483204832048{\textasciicircum}\{3\} grid resolutions. A stationary state is maintained by a stochastic solenoidal forcing at the largest scales. The focus is on the mechanisms of energy exchanges, namely, dissipation, pressure-dilatation correlation and the individual contributing variables. Compressibility effects are studied by decomposing velocity and pressure fields into solenoidal and dilatational components. We suggest a critical turbulent Mach number at about 0.3 that separate two different flow regimes – only at Mach numbers above this critical value do we observe dilatational effects to affect the flow behaviour in a qualitative manner. The equipartition of energy between the dilatational components of kinetic and potential energy, originally proposed for decaying flows at low {MtMtM}\_\{t\}, presents significant scatter at low {MtMtM}\_\{t\}, but appears to be valid at high {MtMtM}\_\{t\} for stationary flows, which is explained by the different role of dilatational pressure in decaying and stationary flows, and at low and high {MtMtM}\_\{t\}. While at low {MtMtM}\_\{t\} pressure possesses characteristics of solenoidal pressure, at high {MtMtM}\_\{t\} it behaves in similar ways to dilatational pressure, which results in significant changes in the dynamics of energy exchanges. This also helps explain the observed qualitative change in the skewness of pressure at high {MtMtM}\_\{t\} reported in the literature. Regions of high pressure are found to be correlated with regions of intense local expansions. In these regions, the density–temperature correlation is also seen to be relatively high. Classical scaling laws for low-order moments originally proposed for incompressible turbulence appear to be only weakly affected by compressibility for the range of {RλRλR}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}it{\textbackslash}lambda\}\} and {MtMtM}\_\{t\} investigated.},

The subgrid scale ({SGS}) kinetic energy flux of the compressive mode is found to be significantly larger than that of the solenoidal mode in the inertial range, which is the main physical origin for the occurrence of Kolmogorov’s −5/3 scaling of the energy spectrum in compressible turbulence. The perfect antiparallel alignment between the large-scale strain and the {SGS} stress leads to highly efficient kinetic energy transfer in shock regions, which is a distinctive feature of shock structures in comparison with vortex structures. The rescaled probability distribution functions of {SGS} kinetic energy flux collapse in the inertial range, indicating a statistical self-similarity of kinetic energy cascades.},

Here we discuss the novel effects arising from the consideration of fluid turbulence confined to two spatial dimensions. The additional conservation constraint on squared vorticity relative to three-dimensional (3D) turbulence leads to the dual-cascade scenario of Kraichnan and Batchelor with an inverse energy cascade to larger scales and a direct enstrophy cascade to smaller scales. Specific theoretical predictions of spectra, structure functions, probability distributions, and mechanisms are presented, and major experimental and numerical comparisons are reviewed. The introduction of 3D perturbations does not destroy the main features of the cascade picture, implying that 2D turbulence phenomenology establishes the general picture of turbulent fluid flows when one spatial direction is heavily constrained by geometry or by applied body forces. Such flows are common in geophysical and planetary contexts, are beautiful to observe, and reflect the impact of dimensionality on fluid turbulence.},

Various subjects are presented: coherent structures, statistical theories, inverse cascade of energy, condensed states, Richardson law, direct cascade of enstrophy, and the inter-play between cascades and coherent structures. The review offers a physicist's view on two-dimensional turbulence in the sense that experimental facts play an important role in the presentation, technical issues are described without much detail, sometimes in an oversimplified form, and physical arguments are given whenever possible.

The case is considered where the fluid is defined over the total region of the surface of a sphere. The nature of the changes in time of the spectral distribution of kinetic energy is discussed on the basis of the two conservation requirements mentioned above. It is found that only fractions of the initial energy can flow into smaller scales and that a greater fraction simultaneously has to flow to components with larger scales. The upper limits to the flow of kinetic energy into components with scales less than a given one are found. The conservation theorems are also used to discuss the stability of a certain stationary flow for a twodimensional motion which is not necessarily spherical. It is shown how important it is for the proof of stability that not only the kinetic energy of the disturbance is supposed to be small but also its vorticitics. In chapter {II} molecular viscosity is taken into account for the spherical flow. Finally some conclusive remarks are offered regarding the fundamental difference between two-and threedimensional flow.},

The classical Kraichnan–Leith–Batchelor paradigm, based on the simultaneous conservation of energy and enstrophy and the scale-selectivity of the molecular viscosity, requires that the domain be unbounded in both directions. For 2D turbulence either in a doubly periodic domain or in an unbounded channel with a periodic boundary condition in the across-channel direction, a direct enstrophy cascade is not possible. In the usual case where the forcing wavenumber is no greater than the geometric mean of the integral and dissipation wavenumbers, constant spectral slopes must satisfy β{\textgreater}5 and α+β≥8, where −α (−β) is the asymptotic slope of the range of wavenumbers lower (higher) than the forcing wavenumber. The influence of a large-scale dissipation on the realizability of a dual cascade is analysed.

	abstract = {This letter investigates the compressible energy transfer process. We extend a methodology developed originally for incompressible turbulence and use databases from numerical simulations of a weak compressible turbulence based on Eddy-Damped-Quasi-Normal-Markovian ({EDQNM}) closure. In order to analyze the compressible mode directly, the well known Helmholtz decomposition is used. While the compressible component has very little influence on the solenoidal part, we found that almost all of the compressible turbulence energy is received from its solenoidal counterpart. We focus on the most fundamental building block of the energy transfer process, the triadic interactions. This analysis leads us to conclude that, at low turbulent Mach number, the compressible energy transfer process is dominated by a local radiative transfer (absorption) in both inertial and energy containing ranges.},

The emphasis is on both analogies and differences with Hamiltonian statistical mechanics, in particular critical phenomena. The method of spectral equations, which plays to a certain extent the role of a mean field theory, is discussed in detail. It is here viewed as a reformulation of the Kolmogorov 1941 theory leading to quantitative insight into the energetics of turbulence (power-law spectra, direct and inverse energy cascades, energy dissipation in the limit of zero viscosity, etc.). In addition, it sheds light on the proven and conjectured properties of the Navier-Stokes and Euler equations which are reviewed in terms more accessible than those of the mathematical literature. There are strong experimental indications (intermittency) that the Kolmogorov 1941 theory is only approximate. Some of the current efforts to handle higher than second order statistics by formal methods inspired from quantum field theory or critical phenomena are also discussed.},

In this form, the relation is similar to that derived by Yaglom for the mean value of the product δu1(δuθ)2 where (δuθ)2 is the square of the temperature increment. Both equations reduce to a ‘four-thirds’ relation for inertialrange separations and differ only through the appearance of the molecular Prandtl number for very small separations. These results are confirmed by experiments in a turbulent wake, albeit at relatively small values of the turbulence Reynolds number.},

	abstract = {Compressible isothermal turbulence is analyzed under the assumption of homogeneity and in the asymptotic limit of a high Reynolds number. An exact relation is derived for some two-point correlation functions which reveals a fundamental difference with the incompressible case. The main difference resides in the presence of a new type of term which acts on the inertial range similarly as a source or a sink for the mean energy transfer rate. When isotropy is assumed, compressible turbulence may be described by the relation −23εeffr=Fr(r), where Fr is the radial component of the two-point correlation functions and εeff is an effective mean total energy injection rate. By dimensional arguments, we predict that a spectrum in k−5/3 may still be preserved at small scales if the density-weighted fluid velocity ρ1/3u is used.},

@thesis{murray_fourier_2018,
	title = {Fourier Phase Dynamics in Turbulent Non-Linear Systems},
	abstract = {The research presented in this thesis examines in detail the role of triad Fourier phase dynamics across a range of turbulent fluid systems. In 1D Burgers, we see a clear link between the Fourier space triad phases and real-space shocks, the key dissipative structures of the dynamics. This link is evident also in the intermittency statistics, where time periods of high phase synchronisation contribute the majority of the extreme events that characterise intermittent behaviour. The reduction of degrees of freedom is also explored, with Fractal Fourier decimation used to remove modes across all scales of the system. We find that the phase synchronisation mechanism is extremely sensitive to such changes, and coherence is quickly lost as degrees of freedom are suppressed. We further extend these phase dynamics concepts by examining the forward enstrophy cascade in 2D Navier Stokes. Again the importance of the triad Fourier phases is clear, with strong preference for values that contribute to the forward cascade. We will see that at a snapshot in time, only a subset of the Fourier modes are responsible for the formation of small-scale vorticity filament structures that govern the total enstrophy dissipation of the ow. The final stage is to expand the definition of the triad Fourier phase to a non-scalar field in 3D Navier-Stokes. Utilising helical mode decomposition, we show the differing behaviour of the helical triad interaction classes and once again how helical triad phases play a vital role in the efficiency and directionality of energy flux in 3D turbulence. In a similar fashion to the 2D Navier-Stokes enstrophy cascade, we again find only a small energetic subset of the Fourier modes are important contributors to the flux toward small scales, and thus to the intermittent bursts of dissipation that characterise these chaotic flows. Finally we discuss how these exciting new results could be applied to other turbulent systems and how such coherent phase dynamics may lead to a better understanding of the mechanism behind Intermittency in Turbulence.},

This tensor encodes interesting geometric and statistical information such as the alignment of vorticity with respect to the strain-rate eigenvectors, rate of deformation and shapes of fluid material volumes, non-Gaussian statistics, and intermittency. In the inertial range of turbulence, similar properties can be described using the coarse-grained or filtered velocity gradient tensor. In this article we review various models that aim at understanding these phenomena using a small number of ordinary differential equations, written either as a low-dimensional dynamical system or as a set of stochastic differential equations. Typically these describe the Lagrangian evolution of the velocity gradient tensor elements following fluid particles and require models for the pressure Hessian and viscous effects. Sample results from various models are shown, and open challenges are highlighted.},
